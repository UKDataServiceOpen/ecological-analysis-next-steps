These diagnostics are an essential first step, but they also raise an important question.\nWhat should we do next when spatial autocorrelation is present?\nThis page introduces regression as a next step in ecological analysis. Its purpose is not to teach software implementation, but to help you understand how regression models can be adapted to spatial data, and how analysts decide which type of spatial model is appropriate.",

    "text": "From diagnostics to modelling\nEarlier in the module, you learned that spatial autocorrelation violates key assumptions of standard regression models. In particular, when neighbouring areas tend to have similar values, the assumption that observations are independent no longer holds. As discussed in the section on spatial autocorrelation, this can lead to misleading statistical inference, such as inflated or deflated test statistics.\nRegression modelling therefore comes after spatial diagnostics.\nA typical analytical workflow is:\n\nA standard regression model is estimated.\nThe residuals are examined for spatial autocorrelation, for example using Moran’s I.\nIf spatial autocorrelation remains, a spatial regression model is considered.\n\nThe models introduced below are designed to respond directly to the issues identified at the final step.",

It provides an initial description of relationships between area level characteristics such as employment rates, housing conditions, or health outcomes. However, as shown earlier in the module, this model assumes that observations are independent across space, an assumption that is rarely satisfied with geographical data.",

    "text": "Allowing relationships to vary across space\nOne reason standard regression may perform poorly with spatial data is that relationships can differ from place to place. The effect of an explanatory variable may not be constant across all areas.\nConceptually, this can be expressed by allowing regression coefficients to vary by spatial unit:\n\\[\ny_i = b_{0i} + b_{1i} x_{1i} + b_{2i} x_{2i} + \\dots + b_{ni} x_{ni} + e_i\n\\]\nThis reflects spatial heterogeneity, a concept introduced earlier in the module. For example, the relationship between health outcomes and access to services may differ between urban and rural areas, or between regions with different socioeconomic contexts.\nIn practice, analysts may choose to allow the intercept to vary across space or explore models that explicitly account for spatial structure rather than assuming uniform effects.",
