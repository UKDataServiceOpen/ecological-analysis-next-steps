# Building a single HTML page for the "Next steps" in Ecological Analysis Rise module

This repo contains a Quarto-based teaching document introducing regression as the next step in ecological analysis. 
It builds conceptually on spatial diagnostics and explains why and how regression models are adapted when spatial dependence is present. 
The material is published as a static HTML page using GitHub Pages and is designed for learning and conceptual understanding rather than software instruction.
